                <h3>What are my hobbies?</h3>
                <p> My hobbies are everything and anything Free & Open source. I am an enthusiest for the open community and privacy respecting community. I have nothing to hide but want to 
                    keep my ability to share rather than their ability to take. One day, you may regret what was taken that you never gave up in the first place. 
                    
                    <ol>
                    <li>I play a FOSS game called 2009scape, it is based on the 2009 era of Runescape and has had a special nostalgic place in my heart </li>
                    <li>I love living through people in Living off the land or Off-Grid homestead videos. I wish that I could convince my wife to say "F" everything and just move with me in the middle of nowhere, we'd figure it out, because we are a team of 
                    survivors. </li> 
                    <li>I love watching tv shows and movies, I am a sucker for a good story and in the past, I was a sucker for books but I feel the world spins so fast nowadays that 
                        movies are the only thing I can squeeze.</li>
