                        <h2>Teen arrested for violent crimes plays race card.</h2>
                        <p>Joan Naydich was attacked by Brendan Dupa after he took away his Nintendo Switch. ‚ÄúSecurity footage captured the 6-foot-6, 270-pound teenager sprinting toward Naydich, knocking her unconscious, stomping on her, and punching her 15 times.‚Äù His mother later claimed that he was being targeted in court because he is Black, suggesting that race was a factor in the prosecution. However, the reality is that he is being prosecuted for nearly killing a teacher over having his Switch taken away. His mother argued that he should be in a mental hospital rather than jail, but typically, people are jailed for crimes, not sent to mental hospitals after committing them. "I had told the school that being hungry, noise, being told 'no,' being corrected in front of others, and electronics were all triggers," his mother said. But this is no excuse‚Äîsomeone that dangerous should not be free if such things provoke such violent behavior. As for the claim that he is being "targeted for being Black," he is only receiving a 5-year sentence, despite also spitting on her, which constitutes another felony.

                        <h2>Fallen World</h2>
                        <p>The future is very uncertain in terms of how it will shape up with the economy, the election, and the seemingly ever-increasing prices of houses. I worry for my children and what they will have to endure throughout their lives, as the world seems to be getting worse. I hope this isn't some apocalyptic time we're living through, as that thought is frightening in itself. Just a small ramble of concern for this fallen world, but hopefully, the next generation can find a way to lift it back up.</p>
