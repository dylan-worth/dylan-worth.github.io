    <h2>About the Project</h2>
    <p>
        Lost City is an open-source RuneScape recreation project led by Pazaz and a team of talented developers.
        Their goal is to preserve and recreate the magic of RuneScape's iconic eras. Two of the biggest projects
        under the Lost City umbrella are <strong>2004scape</strong>, which captures the nostalgia of May 2004, and
        <strong>2019scape</strong>, recreating the features of RuneScape as they were in 2019.
