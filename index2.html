            <p>I started my lifestyle change about two weeks ago and am now entering my third week. I was reflecting on what I was doing wrong in my everyday routine and realized that I was consuming too many calories through drinks and overeating. I used to start my mornings with a Mean Bean Monster, which has 220 calories. During tough financial times, I would buy Polar Pops for 79 cents (or 69 cents when using a phone number at the machine). A 48 oz Polar Pop of Coke was around 530-550 calories. Since a 20 oz Coke is 240 calories, two 20 oz Cokes plus an additional 8 oz was already close to 600 calories. On most days, I ended up drinking about three of them—one at work, one on my way home, and one before bed. This added up to about 2,100 calories between the Polar Pops and coffee. Sometimes, I would also have two coffees in a day, bringing that total to around 2,300 calories just from drinks.
            <br> 
            <br>
            On Fridays, I would almost eat a whole pizza. Whenever I ordered subs, they were full subs, and I would drown my food in condiments, leading to overeating on top of the calorie-heavy drinks. I weighed 218 lbs, the heaviest I've ever been in my life. The first thing I did was switch from the Mean Bean coffee to Monster Zero Sugar, which is 10 calories compared to 220 calories. Throughout the day, I've been drinking water, primarily from glass bottles, as it tastes more refreshing. They are reusable, allowing me to refill them at work, and the water only cost me $2 for the bottle. Now, I have a refillable liter bottle. I also drink sparkling water, whether it’s the good stuff like Pellegrino, or brands like Bubbly/AHA. If I'm desperate, I resort to the Polar Pops, which are in styrofoam and contain microplastics, but like I said, that's only if I'm desperate.
            <br>  
            <br>  
                I've been keeping my calorie intake around 1,400-1,500 calories a day, which is a significant difference from the over 3,000 calories per day I used to consume. In the last two weeks, I've lost 11 lbs and am going strong. When I get home, I do my set of push-ups and sit-ups. I started with 2 sets of 15 push-ups, totaling 30 for the day. Even though I can lift cast iron tubs, I initially lacked the muscle for push-ups. I then increased to 3 sets of 15 with 10-second breaks, focusing on slow release rather than quick push-ups. I moved on to doing both push-ups and sit-ups, increasing my push-ups to 4 sets of 15. I am currently doing 3 sets of 20 push-ups, which is the same total but more per set.
            <br>
            <br>
                I plan to buy a bench, some weights, and other equipment to build muscle. I would like to get a half-gallon glass bottle for water and a lunch/dinner plan. Oh, which reminds me, I don't eat breakfast and don't eat past 8 p.m. It feels like fasting, but since I drink my Monster in the morning, it’s not a complete fast. I try to wait about an hour after waking up before introducing caffeine into my body, which is easy because it takes about an hour between getting up and arriving at work.
            <br>
            <br>
            I still buy the budgeted pizza every week for the kids and my wife, but now I drink a fruit smoothie with some ground beef for dinner instead. It's very hard since I love pizza, but I need to teach my body what is good, and in the future, I can reintroduce homemade pizzas.
            <br>
            <br>
            This concludes my little talk about my lifestyle change. I plan on sharing more of my gains, especially when I get to the point of tracking macros. This is strictly for my website, and I may share my gains on Pixelfed and Instagram.</p>

            <p>As many of you may know, I am a mold technician for the company <a href="https://imold.us/">iMold</a>, working my way to becoming a <span class="tooltip">Mold Assessor<span class="tooltiptext">A Mold Assessor is a licensed and trained professional who identifies the source and severity of a mold problem in a building.</span></span>.
                <br><br> Many people believe mold remediation is a quick cut out and just a sweep up and everything is fine, but that is far from the reality. In mold remediation, either after the demolition or if there was a humidity-driven issue that caused surface growth, we do something called a 'six-sided' cleaning.
                Think of a dresser: we are wiping all four sides, the bottom, the top, and inside. That is six-sided. Now, the time that a six-sided clean takes can vary depending on the amount of content and debris there is. For example, content that has hardly any debris on it can be quickly vacuumed and wiped, and the item can be put away. As for something that has a profuse amount of dust, it may take much longer. 
                In a recent job that was passed, I finished cleaning four rooms in one day, and the office had some content, but that was the keyword - some. This house I am currently working on has well over a thousand objects, which took me three days to clean in the master bedroom. I am being transparent so people understand the process it takes to be thorough. You could potentially pass by quickly wiping the outside of items, even if there was no seal, but that means that you left undisturbed growth to reaffect the air again when the customer uses it again. 
                So let me walk you through the process of the job through a slideshow.
                <br><br> Okay, now that we got some of the jargon out of the way, let's focus on the process. According to the IICRC, "A project might have unique circumstances that may infrequently allow for a deviation from the standard," which is especially true for this job. So let's explain: the norm is to work your way from top to bottom as dust falls, but with the amount of content, there was no way to safely achieve this as there was no place to put this content. So I worked from the back to the front, top to bottom, while moving sections. This created the need for more time. 
                I also had obstacles such as bins that were not sealed, which had tons of small objects that needed to be cleaned thoroughly. There were these little blue caps where I needed to lay them all on a microfiber cloth and spray them down with an <a href="https://www.fiberlock.com/product/shockwave/">antimicrobial</a>, then use another cloth to dry them and put them back into the bin. Each item, from medicine to cords, papers, and more, had cat hair caked on, including caked-in dust. I am posting this because this is some of the most tedious work in the field as the homeowners are still living in the home, creating more dust and cat hair. That is fine because the game was to eliminate the past dust that could have the mycotoxin-producing mold on it, not potential outdoor growth. 
                Before I share these photos, this is strictly for educational purposes of the job, and hopefully, my bosses see it for the reason things take time. Some people go through depression, some go through injuries, and others simply have a hard time keeping up with things, and that isn't anything to joke about. We are here to make their home safe again, and that is all that matters.

            <p>You won't believe this but after 6 years of being engaged, I finally got married! Things ( like having kids ) made the process 
                go on hold for awhile. All I can say is I was able to marry my best friend, Kimberly Worth! She still is going through the process of 
                changing her legal name obviously but I will say it here. We got married, & our family went to the park with us to take beautiful pictures. 
                We went to Outback where my grandma paid for our meal, her mom brought this beautiful wedding cake she bought, and the entire family was there to
                celebrate. Her mom took the kids for the weekend while we went to Port Orleans ( One of the most beautiful resorts that remind me of a Maryland Apartment complex ) 
                and then went to Disney World. I couldn't have asked for a better weekend.
