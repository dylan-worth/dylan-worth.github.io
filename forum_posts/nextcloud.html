            We use apps to store our data, and share memories with friends. However, many large companies take advantage and sell your personal data. It may not seem like a big deal 
            but we should choose who we share our data with. If you are looking for a drive alternative to Google, Microsoft or other big companies. Let's talk about Nextcloud. Nextcloud is a
            <span class="dictionary_foss" style="color:darkcyan">FOSS</span> cloud service that you can run on a local PC.
            <br>
            <br>
            Personally, there are some things online that I don't mind sharing with the world. And, other things that I just want my family to see. However, using cloud services like Google, One Drive, etc.., store all my personal data on their servers. 
            Google recently had an issue with losing 3 months of stored data on someone's drive. That is absolute bonkers. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Once you've got Nextcloud up and running, the possibilities are endless! I highly recommend setting it up on a spare PC or Raspberry Pi for full control. 
            With Nextcloud, you can install various 'apps' to enhance your experience, such as a music app that's like having your own Spotify or YouTube Music, 
            Collabra for all your office needs, and Memories to cherish your precious moments. Not sure where to get started? Check out the <a href="https://nextcloud.com/install/" style="color: darkcyan;">Nextcloud website</a> for guidance on setting up your very own Nextcloud server.
            Or, if you need a video guide on setting this up with Linode check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUQAWvXrtPY" target="_blank" style="color: darkcyan;">Techhut</a> on Youtube.
           </p> <hr> 
            Some of the features that you can get installed on your Nextcloud I mentioned above. I just wanted to go over a few with everyone so they have an idea of what 
            using your own cloud service can do for you.
            <br><br>
            <b><u>Music</u></b>
            <br><br>
            <p>As I quickly mentioned above, this app allows you to play your mp3 files from your cloud service using any device you connect to the cloud. It mimics that Youtube Music 
                app which allows you to make playlist, randomize choices, or have your top picks.</p> 

            <br>
            <br>

            <b>Cons</b>:

            <br>
            <br>

            <p>▸ Limited Features: The Music app for Owncloud with Nextcloud may have limited features compared to dedicated music streaming services. It may lack advanced features like personalized recommendations, curated playlists, or integration with external music libraries.</p>
            <p>▸ Dependency on Self-Hosting: Using the Music app requires hosting your own Nextcloud instance, which may require technical expertise and ongoing maintenance. This can be a barrier for users who prefer a simpler, hosted solution for managing their music collection.</p>
            <p>▸ Performance and Scalability: Depending on the resources available on your server and the number of users accessing the Music app, performance and scalability may be a concern. Large music collections or high traffic can impact the responsiveness of the application.</p>
            <p>▸ Compatibility Issues: The Music app may encounter compatibility issues with certain browsers, devices, or audio file formats. This can result in playback issues or limitations in accessing your music collection across different platforms.</p>
            <p>▸ Limited Integration: The Music app may have limited integration with external services or devices compared to mainstream music streaming platforms. This can limit your ability to access your music collection across different devices or share playlists with friends.</p>
            <p>▸ Lack of Offline Playback: Unlike some dedicated music streaming services, the Music app may not offer offline playback capabilities. This means you may need an internet connection to access your music collection, which can be inconvenient in certain situations.</p>
