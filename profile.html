         Been seeing a lot more videos on trafficking.

Here are somethings I took away from these videos:

• If you get in your car and notice cash in your windshield wipers or your wipers up. Do not touch it. It is to lure you out of your car to go fix them. 

• Do not remove the cash without gloves or something else because apparently they are lacing cash with chemicals. Sometimes they will put it on your door handle. Do not touch your door handle. Get in your car another way.

• A ziptie on your door handle is a way for traffickers to say, "There is someone in this car we can target"

Many advice videos will tell you to go home first. Drive to a police station and just let them know you feel unsafe. You dont want to go straight home incase they follow you home.

Stay safe ladies.

       Jewish people on my feed arguing God wouldn't do this or God wouldn't do that. The argument is as old as humans on who believes what.

  I am a christian, so I believe in Jesus Christ, and I believe that he was the ultimate sacrifice. So, this doesnt remove jews from entering heaven but this allows non jews to also enter heaven. ( Galatians 3:29 )  But neither jew or non jew can enter heaven if they deny Jesus. ( John 3:36 ) This is my belief and no one is going to convince me otherwise when I read the bible daily. Jesus teaches to spread the word. Believe whatever you want to believe because at the end of the day we all have free will. 

This post is being made because they are weaponizing their religious views to try and convince people to support Israel's war crimes in Gaza. I am not going to stand by and watch this as this goes against what Jesus has taught.

        Broke, but gonna start trying to start a budget for buying some monero. The digital id era is coming and it is safe to say that cash will become obsolete before a mandated id is required for work. I plan on at least dumping my money into monero – a privacy based open source crypro and buy the open hardware wallet – Trezor safe 5.

Hoping this reaches some people for feedback on this idea.

         I do this for my wife and kids. If it was just me I'd be out in the woods or dead. My wife caught me at such an awkward time in my life. I was borderline dead and I know I know I shouldn't live for someone. But it wasn't a matter of living FOR them but the concept they helped me find purpose in moving forward and doing what I need to do. I am a huge advocate for freedom of speech. Unless you are physically harming someone which includes pushing towards one's suicide then feel free to say whatever. Actions speak way louder than words and can be applied in every part of life.

         I do miss college sometimes. While I'll be taking online courses when I go back, people don't understand how fantastic it is to bounce ideas off curious, like-minded people. In highschool, most people didn't care, and I can accept why. But if you haven't been to college, you may not understand the true value of discussing and learning things with people who actually want to be there. That is my issue at work sometimes: very few share the passion I have for the topic. Very few go beyond what is taught at work to improve their knowledge. Again, like the highschool, I understand. Not everyone views this as a career. I get excited when discussing pathogens, you can ask anyone. I have an obsession with learning different things. The profound experience of college is something I will never get to experience again since it won't be plausible to take the classes in person while running a business.

        I was always agnostic, never truly atheist. A long time ago, I was abducted with fifteen other kids, and we were tortured. 
        This took place in Silver Spring, MD. I still have the burn marks and cuts from the trauma. 
        As I lay there and screamed for God to save me, there was only silence. 
        I can still hear the dripping of blood from the tables. 
        I can still hear the screams when I close my eyes at night. I resented God.
        <br><br>
        About two years ago, I started doing a deep dive through a money trail to truly understand why there seems to be a slavery system 
        happening today that no one is speaking about. I dug through the families we all know like the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers. 
        I sifted through sources that were clearly conspiratorial, but I could tell which ones were just words. 
        Then there were paths that had money trails attached. 
        It is easy to turn your head away from random words on the internet, but when money is tied to it, numbers hardly lie.
        <br><br>
        As I dug deeper, I realized this world has gotten darker and darker. 
        Some of what I found made me think that maybe I needed to look back into the Bible. 
        I ended up following the teachings from Paul in Acts that spoke about the early Christians called “The Way.” 
        They practiced no judgment of others, still helped people like Jesus did, and showed love overall. 
        Who knows the final outcome, but putting faith in Him costs me nothing.

        Trump used zero tax dollars to build the ballroom. It was funded privately, not from public money.<br><br>
        Here’s some history showing he isn’t the first to modify the White House:
        <br><br>
        <strong>Theodore Roosevelt (1901–1909)</strong> added the West Wing for offices and expanded the family quarters.<br><br>
        <strong>Calvin Coolidge (1923–1929)</strong> reinforced the upper floors and attic to prevent collapse.<br><br>
        <strong>Franklin D. Roosevelt (1933–1945)</strong> added the East Wing and installed an indoor pool.<br><br>
        <strong>Harry S. Truman (1945–1953)</strong> had the interior gutted and rebuilt.<br><br>
        <strong>Dwight D. Eisenhower (1953–1961)</strong> installed a bowling alley.<br><br>
        <strong>Richard Nixon (1969–1974)</strong> converted FDR’s pool into the press room.<br><br>
        <strong>Gerald Ford (1974–1977)</strong> built an outdoor pool on the South Lawn.<br><br>
        <strong>Ronald Reagan (1981–1989)</strong> restored the State Dining Room.<br><br>
        <strong>Bill Clinton (1993–2001)</strong> upgraded wiring and security.<br><br>
        Find real issues to criticize, not a ballroom addition funded privately.

        People are really out here complaining about a higher sales tax on non essential items to replace the money lost from if we remove property tax. 
        You cant make this shit up 😂 Imagine staying with never truly owning your property because you want to avoid clothes now costing more. 
        I mean Desantis hasnt discussed grocery tax or child item tax in replacement. 
        It would more than likely mean non essential items have a higher tax on them.
