        I promise you I can argue any time a day. Morning, afternoon, evening, night, when I first wake up, or right before bed. 
        It doesn't matter the debate. I am going to give you a run for your money because I am autistic af and I just can't accept being wrong unless you 100% can prove I am. 
        99.9%? Nah you slippin with that .1%.

        People are really out here complaining about a higher sales tax on non essential items to replace the money lost from if we remove property tax. 
        You cant make this shit up 😂 Imagine staying with never truly owning your property because you want to avoid clothes now costing more. 
        I mean Desantis hasnt discussed grocery tax or child item tax in replacement. 
        It would more than likely mean non essential items have a higher tax on them.

        I guess we won't visit Europe 🍻<br><br>
        "The European Union is implementing a new Entry/Exit System (EES) that requires biometric data, including fingerprints and facial images, 
        from travelers from countries outside the Schengen Area, including the United States, starting October 12, 2025. 
        This system is being rolled out gradually across 29 countries, including most EU members and non-EU Schengen countries like Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland. 
        Travelers who refuse to provide their biometric data will be denied entry to the Schengen Area."

        There is a real evil in this world explained by a giant money trail. 
        I am at this point where I just want to homestead and get away from this corrupt world. 
        Just letting you guys know that I am not suicidal.

        Trump used zero tax dollars to build the ballroom. It was funded privately, not from public money.<br><br>
        Here’s some history showing he isn’t the first to modify the White House:<br><br>
        <strong>Theodore Roosevelt (1901–1909)</strong><br>
        Added the West Wing for offices and expanded the family quarters, turning an aging home into a true executive residence.<br><br>
        <strong>Calvin Coolidge (1923–1929)</strong><br>
        Reinforced the upper floors and attic to prevent a collapse. Practical repairs without fanfare.<br><br>
        <strong>Franklin D. Roosevelt (1933–1945)</strong><br>
        Added the East Wing, which is the same area being modernized today, and installed an indoor pool to help with polio therapy.<br><br>
        <strong>Harry S. Truman (1945–1953)</strong><br>
        Had the entire interior gutted and rebuilt due to serious structural issues. The exterior stayed the same, but the inside was completely reconstructed.<br><br>
        <strong>Dwight D. Eisenhower (1953–1961)</strong><br>
        Installed a bowling alley inside the White House for relaxation.<br><br>
        <strong>Richard Nixon (1969–1974)</strong><br>
        Converted FDR’s old indoor pool into the press briefing room that still exists today.<br><br>
        <strong>Gerald Ford (1974–1977)</strong><br>
        Built an outdoor pool on the South Lawn after the indoor one was repurposed.<br><br>
        <strong>Ronald Reagan (1981–1989)</strong><br>
        Restored the State Dining Room and several public areas to their historic beauty.<br><br>
        <strong>Bill Clinton (1993–2001)</strong><br>
        Upgraded the building’s wiring, security, and early internet systems to bring it into the modern era.<br><br>
        Find some real issues to criticize, not a ballroom addition not even funded by tax dollars.
