        I was always agnostic, never truly atheist. A long time ago, I was abducted with fifteen other kids, and we were tortured. 
        This took place in Silver Spring, MD. I still have the burn marks and cuts from the trauma. 
        As I lay there and screamed for God to save me, there was only silence. 
        I can still hear the dripping of blood from the tables. 
        I can still hear the screams when I close my eyes at night. I resented God.
        <br><br>
        About two years ago, I started doing a deep dive through a money trail to truly understand why there seems to be a slavery system 
        happening today that no one is speaking about. I dug through the families we all know like the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers. 
        I sifted through sources that were clearly conspiratorial, but I could tell which ones were just words. 
        Then there were paths that had money trails attached. 
        It is easy to turn your head away from random words on the internet, but when money is tied to it, numbers hardly lie.
        <br><br>
        As I dug deeper, I realized this world has gotten darker and darker. 
        Some of what I found made me think that maybe I needed to look back into the Bible. 
        I ended up following the teachings from Paul in Acts that spoke about the early Christians called ‚ÄúThe Way.‚Äù 
        They practiced no judgment of others, still helped people like Jesus did, and showed love overall. 
        Who knows the final outcome, but putting faith in Him costs me nothing.

        Trump used zero tax dollars to build the ballroom. It was funded privately, not from public money.<br><br>
        Here‚Äôs some history showing he isn‚Äôt the first to modify the White House:
        <br><br>
        <strong>Theodore Roosevelt (1901‚Äì1909)</strong> added the West Wing for offices and expanded the family quarters.<br><br>
        <strong>Calvin Coolidge (1923‚Äì1929)</strong> reinforced the upper floors and attic to prevent collapse.<br><br>
        <strong>Franklin D. Roosevelt (1933‚Äì1945)</strong> added the East Wing and installed an indoor pool.<br><br>
        <strong>Harry S. Truman (1945‚Äì1953)</strong> had the interior gutted and rebuilt.<br><br>
        <strong>Dwight D. Eisenhower (1953‚Äì1961)</strong> installed a bowling alley.<br><br>
        <strong>Richard Nixon (1969‚Äì1974)</strong> converted FDR‚Äôs pool into the press room.<br><br>
        <strong>Gerald Ford (1974‚Äì1977)</strong> built an outdoor pool on the South Lawn.<br><br>
        <strong>Ronald Reagan (1981‚Äì1989)</strong> restored the State Dining Room.<br><br>
        <strong>Bill Clinton (1993‚Äì2001)</strong> upgraded wiring and security.<br><br>
        Find real issues to criticize, not a ballroom addition funded privately.

        People are really out here complaining about a higher sales tax on non essential items to replace the money lost from if we remove property tax. 
        You cant make this shit up üòÇ Imagine staying with never truly owning your property because you want to avoid clothes now costing more. 
        I mean Desantis hasnt discussed grocery tax or child item tax in replacement. 
        It would more than likely mean non essential items have a higher tax on them.
