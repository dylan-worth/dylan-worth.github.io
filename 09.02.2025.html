    <h1>My Daughter Turns 7 Today!</h1>
    <p>
      Seven years ago I became a dad for the very first time. My oldest daughter, the one who made me a father, is celebrating her 7th birthday today.
    </p>
    <p>
      She is the leader of the pack, oldest of four kids, and she has a personality that fills the whole room. She loves <strong>Stitch</strong> (yes, she has watched <em>Lilo & Stitch</em> more times than I can count and can quote him perfectly). She enjoys playing <strong>Roblox</strong> (supervised of course) and she is already turning into quite the <strong>artist</strong>. For her age I think she has real talent, her sketches and doodles surprise me all the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      She is also completely in love with <strong>music</strong>. Whether she is singing, dancing, or just filling the house with her favorite songs, there is always a rhythm following her around.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am proud of her not only because she is creative, fun, and bright, but because she was the one who started this whole adventure for me as a dad.
