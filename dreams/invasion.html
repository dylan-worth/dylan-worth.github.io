            &nbsp; Invasion is a creepy title name, I know. I was talking to one of my co workers about everything happening in the world with the different wars brewing.
            During the Pacific Strategy of World World 2, Japan was planning their attack on the United States which is included invading our land. Recently on the news
            we seem a similar trend with China's Balloons. Talking back and forth of what we would do incase of an invasion. 
            <br>
            &nbsp; Later that night, I had a dream about the beginning of a war with China. Kim, my kids, and I were all preparing to leave to get somewhere safe since I remember
            reading of a lot of invasions in History. We bunker down in this one barn getting ready to keep moving and I could see the grass starting to move and a loud aircraft
            up above. It wasn't just one but multiple and you could hear the air peircing bombs fall from the planes. As they hit, I could feel a wave of heat go through the air.
            As I turn around to run to my family, a bomb falls right on the cabin. The best way I can describe it was like a donkey kong crate that has a bomb inside. The barn busted 
            open as you could see a molten core escape from the inside. I woke up.
