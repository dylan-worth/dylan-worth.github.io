                <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
                <p>By accessing this website or booking an assessment, you agree to be bound by these Terms and Conditions. We provide specialized property diagnostics, including PRV inspections and moisture mapping, subject to the following terms.</p>

                <h2>2. Scope of Services</h2>
                <p>We provide independent, third-party assessments. While we utilize advanced infrared technology and scientific testing, our reports represent the condition of the property at the specific time and date of the inspection. We do not provide remediation services ourselves, ensuring our results remain unbiased.</p>

                <h2>3. Limitation of Liability</h2>
                <p>Our assessments are based on visible and accessible areas of the property. We are not liable for defects or moisture issues located in inaccessible areas (e.g., behind permanent fixtures or underground) that cannot be detected via non-invasive technology.</p>

                <h2>4. Payments and Cancellations</h2>
                <p>Payments for services are due upon receipt of the final report unless otherwise agreed in writing. Cancellations made less than 24 hours before a scheduled on-site assessment may be subject to a service fee.</p>

                <h2>5. Report Usage</h2>
                <p>The reports we provide are intended for the sole use of the client and their designated representatives (such as insurance adjusters or contractors). Unauthorized reproduction or distribution of our proprietary diagnostic data is prohibited.</p>

                <h2>6. Governing Law</h2>
                <p>These terms are governed by the laws of the jurisdiction in which the assessment is performed.</p>

                <h2>7. Contact</h2>
                <p>For questions regarding these terms, contact <strong>dylan@smbassessments.com</strong>.</p>
