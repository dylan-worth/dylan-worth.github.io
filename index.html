            <p>You won't believe this but after 6 years of being engaged, I finally got married! Things ( like having kids ) made the process 
                go on hold for awhile. All I can say is I was able to marry my best friend, Kimberly Worth! She still is going through the process of 
                changing her legal name obviously but I will say it here. We got married, & our family went to the park with us to take beautiful pictures. 
                We went to Outback where my grandma paid for our meal, her mom brought this beautiful wedding cake she bought, and the entire family was there to
                celebrate. Her mom took the kids for the weekend while we went to Port Orleans ( One of the most beautiful resorts that remind me of a Maryland Apartment complex ) 
                and then went to Disney World. I couldn't have asked for a better weekend.
