        <p> My baby girl had <a href="https://seuss.fandom.com/wiki/Dr._Seuss_Wiki">Dr Seus</a> week at her Preschool. I can not believe how big she is getting. She turns 
            six years old this week which is unbelievable. I love her so much and I thought I'd share with the world.

        <p> I have plenty of hobbies that I try to accomplish in my super limited time, but I always come back to this one. I finally have reached close to 200 updates 
            for the hobby project located here: <a style="color:darkcyan;" href="https://gitlab.com/custom-09/open881" target="_blank">Open881</a>.

        <p>This is my baby Evelyn, she is almost 10 months old and is so full of life. She means the absolute world to me as do my other babies.

        <p>I created a new section all together for my blogs. This section will more than likely be my "News" section where I post things linking towards 
            <a style="color: darkcyan;" href="blog.html">Blogs</a>, <a style="color: darkcyan;" href="videos.html">Videos</a>, <a style="color: darkcyan;" href="dreams.html">Dreams</a>, and more! I will more than likely post a photo in
            this like if it was a regular social media post and then also have it in my <a style="color: darkcyan;" href="photos.html">Albums</a>.

        <p>As you can see, I started a blog back in 2021 thinking that I could maintain it. I thought about keeping a new section on here
            all about dreams. I've been having very vivid dreams and I'd love to bring my opinions into it. You can check out my latest dream journal here:

        <p>In this blog post I demonstrate what the first blog will look like in terms of a different page but also introduce
            my son! <a style="color: darkcyan;" href="blogs/2021/December/12-02-2021.html">Read More</a>.

        <p> While this is not the most complete website and most likely will be a long work in progress I would just like to state that this 
            website may look funky at times. It is best viewed on desktop as I'm typing this but later will become more mobile friendly. I have 
            been looking for my little corner of the internet for awhile now and even though this is being hosted by GitHub, I will eventually
            move this to my own server so I no longer will have to keep it a static website. 
            <br>
            <br>
            My first goals with this website is to start getting a small foundation of a Facebook-feel profile that I can use since 
            I really enjoy the look. It will not share the full Facebook look as I like to switch it up with my own feel at times. I am not 
            using this website professionally at this time and will be focusing primarily on just getting small fun things for myself 
            and people close to me. 
            <br>
            <br>
            This pretty much sums up my first little blog post and I will continue to post my feelings here since this is a safe place 
            and eventually even create an archive for all of them. This post will be the only post where it takes up the screen 
            since I will be making seperate web pages for you to view the entire thing. I just want this as the pinned post on the blog 
            and if you would like to learn a little more about me check out my about page using the links or <a style="color:darkcyan" href="about.html">here</a>.</p>
