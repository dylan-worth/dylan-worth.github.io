                <p>As 2025 comes to a close, I find myself reflecting on a year defined by significant transitions and professional growth. Most notably, I’ve completed my final full year at iMold, marking the end of a pivotal chapter in my career. During this time, we successfully earned our Water Restoration Technician (WRT) certification, a milestone that solidifies our technical expertise in the field. To further internalize this knowledge, I developed a fully functional quiz tool specifically for the WRT, bridging the gap between field work and digital development.</p>

                <p>The digital side of my journey also gained considerable momentum this past year. I managed to build and launch multiple websites, including SMBAssessments and Dylan-Work, which allowed me to flex my muscles in web architecture and project management. On a more personal note, I’ve stayed deeply committed to cultivating better tech habits with my younger two children. Balancing the demands of the digital world with meaningful family interaction has been a consistent focus, and while it’s a work in progress, the steps we've taken feel substantial.</p>

                <p>However, the year wasn’t without its setbacks, specifically regarding financial discipline. I’ll be the first to admit that I failed at keeping a consistent budget throughout 2025. This shortfall served as a necessary wake-up call, highlighting the areas where I need to tighten my focus to ensure long-term stability. Acknowledging this reality is the first step toward correcting the course, and I’m heading into the new year with a much clearer understanding of the discipline required to manage a growing business and household.</p>

                <p>Looking ahead to 2026, my primary objective is to transition from an employee mindset to one of full ownership. The most critical step on this roadmap is officially filing for my LLC and establishing three distinct streams of income to diversify our financial base. I am also prioritizing my professional credentials, with plans to obtain my OSHA 10, CIE, and MRSA certifications. These aren’t just badges of honor; they are the tools we need to provide higher-tier services as we move toward hosting multiple marketing events to scale our reach.</p>

                <p>Finally, 2026 will be the year we shore up our foundational logistics and security. This includes the practical task of getting the car fully repaired and building a robust emergency fund to act as a buffer against the unexpected. By combining these technical certifications with a revamped approach to budgeting and aggressive marketing, I am confident that the upcoming year will transform our current momentum into a sustainable, independent business. The foundation is laid, the lessons are learned, and it’s time to get to work.</p>
