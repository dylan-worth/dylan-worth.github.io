                 &nbsp; Alright, It is time to become Alice and go down this wild rabit hole of adventure! I am just your average obese male. I mean I am not one of those really big guys pushing 250+, I am just 
                your average 200+ male that drinks soda, eats candy, and scarfs down fast food. I work in a very labor intensive field of mold remediation. I bust down all the walls in a house and burn 
                a good amount of calories. This is the only reason I'm not that really big guy pushing that super heavy weight. Now that we got my description out of the way, we can start discussing this process.
                <br>
                <br>
                 &nbsp; I wanted to describe who I am so you didn't think I was some health nut feeding you that mumbo jumbo garbage of "You gotta get healthy!" I was the absolute last person to give you any advice 
                    on food at all. It all started when I watched this one Youtube short about how Mcdonalds used a specific potato for their french fries to create that bouquet look to them. They want no blemishes at all 
                    and sometimes the potatoes get little brown lines. In order to eliminate this is to use a pesticide called Monitor where Farmers won't even leave their house for five days after spraying. Then the potato isn't 
                    even edible until a full three weeks later. So, I did anything your typical obese male would do. Get free Mcdonalds fries on Mcdonalds Fry Day. This is the first time though that I had 
                    guilt from what I ate. I usually just felt like crap, had incongestion, and said I'd do better another time. This time, I absolutely felt disqusted with myself. This did not stop me whatsoever for the next 
                    couple of days. 
                    
                <br>
                <br>

                 &nbsp; It was finally the weekend, I had some time by myself, so I watched some Youtube videos. All of these videos were Documentaries on Food. I would binge watch some Santa Cruz Medicinals 
                which always made me feel bad about seed oils. I finally watched a full video from him on Seed oils. The process of how they make seed oils is quite insane. Basically they start
                buy separating the seeds. The seeds fall down this conveyer that has a magnet to catch any metals that may have been mixed in with it. They heat them to extreme heat to create the oil from the seeds. They 
                have to use Hexane ( a petroleum-based solvent) to maximize the amount of oil. They have to deoderize them, where they add bleach and other parts of the process creates transfats. 

                <br>

                &nbsp; We then go down even further down the rabbit hole and learn all about tap water. If there was one thing I was so conflicted about learning, it would be our tap water. Our tap water has 
                so many bad things in it. From the forever chemicals of PFAS, Chlorine, medication, and even birth control. There is really no way of escape either because most bottle industries basically just 
                rebottle tap and sell it back to you for a mark up of 3000%. The only true way to get around this is to use a reverse osmosis system, which that needs to be cleaned every couple of months extremely well 
                and honestly replaced every so often as well. Or you can buy Italian water in glass bottles to avoid the BPA/BPS in plastic and the tap water crap.
