           <p> Welcome to the first official blog post! while the actual first was just an introductory to the website! I am pleased 
            to say that I will be working on making this website a lot smoother the further a long we get. Yes, it looks exactly 
            like the rest of the site besides the blog. I am trying to keep the feel of the website mainly the same from the photos 
            that are shared to the content. I am going to limit the photos that get uploaded here in the mean time since I am using 
            Github as the current host but will be using my own soon enough.

            My son just turned 2 today! the big 2! It is crazy to think about how fast he has been growing and it's even more insane that  
            he is learning so much everyday. Today, we were a tad low on money so we threw him a small get together at my fiancee's mom's house 
            to celebrate. He still did not eat his cake which sucks but at least he had a good time and opened a few gifts. It ended with a 
            little bit of play time at the house before bed which was a fantastic day. 

            <br>

            My ultimate goal for this website is to share things of my family that I feel like I want to share while also posting projects 
            I may work on or just the overall opinions of what is going on with everything that is going on. Thanks for reading if you have 
            read this but if not that's completely fine since I am mainly journaling to get everything out into one space.
