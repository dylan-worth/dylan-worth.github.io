                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>So, in this blog, I planned on writing about my new challenge that is gonna potentially make my inner addict lose my mind. I am starting this Free 
                    and Open source challenge to get away from my crippling social media addiction but to get away from the Matrix in regards of their propietary networks. 
                    I wanted to use this small area to explain the few apps that I will sadly have to keep using as they are ones in my every day life. </p>
                  
                    
                        <p class="checkmark"><b><i>Albiware:</i></b> <br> This is a propietary app that I have to use for work for clocking in & out, when I eventually switch to grapheneOS, I will need to figure 
                            out a way to access this feature. Potentially, I could just login over a broser, but I'll have to do some digging. </p>
                       
                        <p class="checkmark"><b><i>Banking App:</i></b> This will go away once I end up getting grapheneOS, as they don't work on that OS, which is fine because they inject their garbage in 
                            your phone anyways.</p>
                        
                        <p class="checkmark"><b><i>Youtube:</i></b> So, for casual watching, I will be limiting myself to this application. I will use it if I need to look something up for work, or 
                            any household tutorials that I can't find on Odysee. As for the people I follow, maybe I could write them to start an Odysee since it can be mirrored.
                        </p>    
                        <p class="checkmark"><b><i>ChatGPT:</i></b> My subscription ends on the 5th, so I'll be using this until then. I will use it especially for writing me stories to read and finding open source 
                            content. </p>
                        <p class="checkmark"> <b><i>Github:</i></b> This is the only website that will stay in my list regardless. I use it for hosting this site through Github Pages, but despite it holdings thousands 
                            of repos, it is propietary. I will be forking from Gitlab if they have the alternative but Github is not restricted. </p>
                
                <h3>Replacement Apps/Software</h3>
                 <p>While these apps may have to be used from time to time the goal is to replace all the apps with ones that I can replace. The others will come in do time and pretty quickly when 
                    I have to figure stuff out with grapheneOS. Under, I plan on listing the common apps I plan on replacing and I hope it can help you.
                 </p>

                 <p class="checkmark"><b><i>Proton Suite:</i></b> I wanted to discuss this one first as it will replace quite a bit of my every day applications. Disclaimer: I pay $11.99/month for their premium service.
                   <br> <span class="tab"></span> <b class="bullet"><i>Proton Mail</i></b>: It is an end to end encrypted email service. 
                   <br> <span class="tab"></span> <b class="bullet"><i>Proton Pass</i></b>: It is a password manager that is encrypted.
                   <br> <span class="tab"></span> <b class="bullet"><i>Proton Calendar</i></b>: It is an encrypted calendar.
                   <br> <span class="tab"></span> <b class="bullet"><i>Proton Mail</i></b>: It is an encrypted drive, it has a photos section, and it has a doc editor.
                   <br> <span class="tab"></span> <b class="bullet"><i>Proton VPN</i></b>: End to end encrypted where they can't see your activity of what you are doing on the VPN.</p>
                 <p class="checkmark"><b><i>Open Street Maps:</i></b> This is a free and open-source app where you download the area that you want to map out. For example, I downloaded my entire state, so I'm able to use it on the streets app and use it offline as well. </p>
                 <p class="checkmark"><b><i>Ente Photos:</i></b> This is a free and open-source app that allows me to have my 'Google Photos' vibe with memories. You can get 5GB of free storage, but I went ahead and upgraded to $2.99/month for now, until I get my NAS and Nextcloud set up. It's a gorgeous application that is also end-to-end encrypted! </p>
                 <p class="checkmark"><b><i>Revolt:</i></b> If you have used Discord for community chats while gaming, then Revolt will excite you. This is a Discord look-alike that is free and open-source. You can host your own server or create a community in the official servers.</b></p>

                 <p>All my pages are dynamic, I will be posting more but I ran out of time.</p>
